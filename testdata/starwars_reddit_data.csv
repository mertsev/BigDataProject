72,Just a friendly reminder: The characters are portrayed by actors.,"The movie  regardless of its score or critical reception  will be a subject to a series opinions and arguments.

Some of them will be hostile  some of them will be civil. 

But at no point should it be acceptable to start trashing the actors  no matter which character they portrayed.

Looking back to the likes of Hayden Christensen  Jake Lloyd and more recently Kellie Marie Tran  it would be safe to say they received a lot of criticism and hate for their roles. These are just people doing their jobs  the fault with the character they portray  especially with Star Wars  is the dialogue and story arcs - something that is the fault of the director and not the actor.

They didn‚Äôt write the lines  they didn‚Äôt create the story  they are not responsible for how bad or good a movie is  and can only work with what they‚Äôre given - bad lines or not.

It is absolutely shocking the way Star Wars actors/actresses have been treated in the past - they‚Äôre playing fictional characters  who are nothing like themselves in the real world and should not be treated like garbage because you didn‚Äôt like the character they acted as.",197,1124,movies,0.82,33,12,837,4501,2019-12-19 16:35:11
73,Say what you want about George Lucas's sub-plot decisions but can we have a thread to celebrate his amazing ability to consistently create rock solid world building and long ranging storylines?,"I can argue about some stupid in-arc plot points ""midichlorians/whills  what?"". But the over-arching storyline that governed the entire trilogy of the senate  the corruption of the jedi by being the best in the galaxy (arrogance/pride/unbending)  and the poignant rise of fascism to combat the uncertainty of the chaos in the senate/galaxy  was amazing.

108,Please stop spreading hate for a movie you haven‚Äôt even seen.,"This will be my final time on Reddit till I see TROS  I‚Äôve stayed off r/StarWars and r/StarWarsCantina for the past few day minus the few things that pop up in my feed and of those things popping up in my feed are memes dissing the new movie... there‚Äôs a Game of Thrones hate sub dissing the new movie like they‚Äôre getting some allies or something!? 

This is ridiculous. None of these people have seen the movie  they have not formed an opinion for themselves based on their own experience  they are going entirely off of what critics are having to say; rather ironic considering it‚Äôs the same loud people who disagreed with the critics following The Last Jedi  but now they‚Äôre siding with them when it‚Äôs convenient to their hate. This is ridiculous and I‚Äôm ashamed to be around some of the most closed minded Star Wars fans of all time. 

Growing up with the prequels I thought I‚Äôd seen all the hate possible for a Star Wars movie  but here we are; people bashing a movie that hasn‚Äôt even released to the public yet... pathetic.

In conclusion  forget what all these people are trying to force down everyone‚Äôs throats in their toxic echo chamber and go and enjoy the finale of the Skywalker Saga. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll laugh  cheer  and cry for a movie that probably takes similar risks to what a Star Wars movie should.

170,TROS (No-Spoilers) thoughts,"I'll admit - this film has majorly confused me for the most part. On the one hand it feels just as star wars as ever - too predictable and perhaps too safe in many of the key plot points it explores rather than going into something new or at least provided good opportunities for new ideas. 

On the other... Well... This film really doesn't feel like star wars at all. It almost feels alien. There's something so off about some aspects in terms of their tone  scope and atmosphere that I just don't know want to think. It's far more 'wtf?' than 'wtf!' if you catch my drift.

I'm not entirely sure how these 2 ideas can co-exist but I guess that's star wars for ya. 

I'll also admit that  unlike the OG trilogy or even the prequels  the sequel trilogy now doesn't properly gel together. The original trilogy feels like one cohesive  co-ordinated vision  beautifully executed for the most part; and the prequels feel united in their tone and scope  even if that can be a contributing factor to their mediocrity. 

The sequels  following this train of logic  feel like a mish-mash of chaotic  counteractive ideas given form; the notable culprit being the fact this isn't the grand scheme of one mastermind. J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson both have both contributed excellent films to the star wars franchise with TFA and TLJ  but these 2 films don't work together and don't work when trying to create an understandable conclusion. 

Here's the thing: if either Abrams or Johnson had the full reign of all 3 films  I think the overall quality of the trilogy would have been greatly improved. I greatly enjoy both Abram's fanfare approach  with some balls to the walls insanity thrown in  and Johnson's deconstructions with a more grounded feel. But just because I enjoy both I don't want them together. It's like combining ice cream and roast potatoes - some things  no matter how good apart  shouldn't mix. 

I'll leave on this: I'm tentatively excited for what's to come. I want to see more of these characters and the world they inhabit  and I want to see more people offer their takes and perspectives on this grand universe. But  maybe  instead of trying to put the cart before the horse  we should first agree who's driving.",391,2227,Movies,0.73,5,1,377,1837,2019-12-19 20:34:12
171,Today is the day.,"Today is the day. 

It‚Äôs a bittersweet feeling as I pick up my son from school and head to the theater to wait in line to see the Skywalker saga come to a close. 

I was born in 1977 and had a name for approximately three months before the first Star Wars film was unleashed on the world. So in a way  I was born into this mythology. I was there at the beginning  and with a lot of emotion am now here for it‚Äôs end. Star Wars will go on  but this is the final chapter with the cast of characters that have been with me from the very start. 

I choked up when the title of this film was shown to the world; the Skywalkers have  in some fashion  always been a presence in my life. Star Wars has been my story  my mythos  my fantasy universe from the beginning  through my formative years  through life choices good and bad  successes  failures  all the highs and lows of my life...the Skywalkers have been my other family. And whether it ends poorly or well  I will be there. I wouldn‚Äôt miss it for the world.

So we go to join a throng of people each with their own unique reasons for why it is special to them  but many with stories that share elements of my own. Being there together with my son  my partner  and our unborn child to witness how it all ends means the world to me.",252,1280,,0.88,6,2,533,117,2019-12-19 21:32:36

186,[No spoilers] I disagree with a lot of the Episode 9 reviews on a couple of things,"While I agree the movie could've been a bit better  there are a few things that I found bewildering when reading some of the professional reviews:

I've read some reviews of the new movie  and many of the reviewers seem to be of the opinion that the movie is some kind of ""pat on the back"" for the generation that grew up with Star Wars  trying to pluck at nostalgia. When the movie ended  I instead got a feeling that this is/was the new Star Wars of the next generation  the current one ending  and got no vibes about ""being made to feel important"" as some reviews suggest. I honestly don't understand those implications at all  and I am from the generation who grew up with the old films. Old stuff was bid farewell  and new stuff was introduced. Happens all the time.

I mean sure  there was some nostalgia stuff involved; but **how could there not be?** Another saga  so enormously gigantic  like Star Wars will probably never exist again for various reasons. Some homage is always paid in things like this; be it movies  video games  or anything that is massive  genre defining  with a global following. I believe it is even **expected ** whether people like to admit it or not: Young generation OR old  if everything Star Wars is would just be thrown out the window and replaced with something completely new  no homage paid  I believe EVERYONE would be mad and unsatisfied. I would imagine it's a tough job for the creators to balance with.

I also find it very odd why many reviewers have a need to inject adversary/juxtaposition into the whole thing. Claims such as ""The Force Awakens was about the franchise not **belonging** to the older generation anymore"" and ""Episode 9 tries to make the older generation feel like **they're** still the stars"" and similiar **sillyness.**

Why can't it be **everyone's** Star Wars? Why does it have to be the older generations or the youngers? Why would you even dictate something like that? **Who made that rule?**

I believe no one. Or even if some reviewers are unable to ""not-generation-categorize"" the movies and the franchise  I don't consider it anything more than their subjective opinion.",376,2145,Movies,0.73,5,13,51,879,2019-12-19 20:26:21

191,The end of the saga. What are your best Star Wars memories?,"Through good times and bad  Star Wars has meant a lot to us. Today is the end of the saga that started all of this 42 years ago. No matter how much you currently love or hate Star Wars  tonight is the last time we are going to see the iconic opening crawl. We each have our own unique story on how we got into Star Wars as well as cherished memories. I think today is a great day to think back and reflect on them.

Some of my favorite memories: Being introduced to Star Wars from those black VHS tapes. Playing all the Star Wars video games growing up  especially Shadows of the Empire on the N64. Being 11 years old and going to see Episode 1 opening day. All the hype going into Force Awakens. Watching Last Jedi opening day in the hangar bay of an aircraft carrier. Watching my toddler run around in an AT-AT shirt playing with Star Wars toys.
 
It‚Äôs hard not to be a bit emotional today. I know this isn‚Äôt the end of Star Wars entirely  but in some ways it feels like it. It has brought so many people together and I hope it continues to do so for many generations to come.

245,I have changed my mind on TLJ ...,"I loved it in theaters even though I only saw it twice   but now   after my most recent re-watch ‚Ä¶ man Rian Johnson was so close to delivering a masterpiece   but he made some terrible decisions that just make the movie so dumb. The movie is well crafted  there are just too many boneheaded ideas/decisions ‚Ä¶ it is better written/acted/directed than the prequels but nowhere near as creative ‚Ä¶ I now rank it on par with ROTS just above TPM and AOC

1. I like Luke in the movie  that didn't bother me  would have like to have seen his actions at the end be retold / impact more than just the kids on Canto Bight but Luke was great 
2. Snoke was great as were Rey and Ben
3. Cinematography  sets  and world building all great as well as the music

The issues

1. The bombers that fly slower than a walkers pace ‚Ä¶ this was ridiculous ‚Ä¶ just make bombers that fly at normal speed? These ships would always be blown up   absolutely terrible
2. The lightspeed tracking was fine ‚Ä¶ the issue being why wouldn't the FO send every single tie fighter out there and just barrage them ‚Ä¶ Kylo and two ships essentially wiped out their biggest ship and all their leadership ‚Ä¶ you're telling me all of a sudden the FO/Empire cares about losing a few tie fighters? Each of the FO ships probably had 1000+ tie fighters
3. does the FO not have scouts/reconnaissance/eyes? The resistance used a cloaking device  big deal  you can't see 30/50 ships leaving the only ship in front of your face? 
4. where did all the people go? When crait battle starts you have hundreds if not a thousand soldiers outside fighting ‚Ä¶ at the end they have like 15 total people boarding the falcon
5. Rose should never have  been in the movie / the saving Finn thing was so awful 

Fixing it. 

1. once the resistance realizes they can be tracked   they could have worked up a plan to get everyone on the main ship by one or more jumps to get closer to Crait   leia should have sent Poe and Finn to Canto Bight to find the code breaker ‚Ä¶ have holdo stay behind to do the ramming while the rest abandon ship to Crait
2. no rose 
3. no bombers that fly at 2 mph 
4. montage at end showing the different people and systems retelling / being inspired by Luke's return",418,2222,Movies,0.6,8,42,243,4202,2019-12-19 14:58:28

That should be problem solved. But for some reason everyone has decided to post in the title their opinion of the movie. So despite how much i have been trying to avoid seeing opinions before i see it (AND ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET) I already know that people hate it. I see titles on Reddit and on Youtube like   ‚ÄúTROS is trash and heres why‚Äù ‚ÄúStar Wars tanks and is a disaster‚Äù ‚ÄúWorst Star Wars movie yet‚Äù.

251,All the good things about the new movie (Spoilers),"Ignoring the whole plot and the entire new trilogy  what were your favourite moments?

Mine was the short scene with Leia and Luke training. That was amazing to see.
Young Luke was acceptable CGI  a bit uncanny valley and it looked more like hoth Luke than ROTJ Luke  but that's nothing.

Leia was a bit worse  it was obvious Leia's face was pasted on her daughter  and I barely recognized her as Leia until she smiled.

But the scene itself was a great addition. 

I loved that Leia became Rey's master and that she is a jedi too.

The PT is the only trilogy with an actually good plot  there's a reason why Lucas love the Prequels more than the OT  It's because that's the story he put far more thoughts and efforts on.

256,Hayden Christensen‚Äôs acting is very under appreciated,"I just finished rewatching the prequels after watching the originals and honestly think the complaints about Hayden‚Äôs acting are very overstated. 

The first thing is his body language and facial expressions. They are on point pretty much all the time. He portrays Anakins anger very well. 

Looking at him when he‚Äôs not speaking  like when he‚Äôs marching with the clones in ROTS  and when he‚Äôs burning on Mustafar with Obi Wan  he really evokes the anger you‚Äôd expect from Anakin Skywalker at this point. 

The second thing is his voice and dialogue. Obviously some of the lines are cringe  but generally they make sense for a boy who has essentially been emotionally repressed for years. He can be a bit too creepy with Padme is AOTC  but that‚Äôs not something he should be blamed for. 

His voice though  the way he pronounces certain words  and his sort of monotonous tone are very in line with Vader in the originals. One specific example is listening to the way Hayden says ‚Äúmaster ‚Äù it‚Äôs very Vader-esque. It makes the transition from Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader very seamless. 

I think that‚Äôs the main thing  people say he sounds awkward and that he is cringe  but some of that is just writing. He‚Äôs meant to be Darth Vader  and at times he could have more emotion in his tone  but he also has to be a realistic predecessor to Darth Vader  and I think he nails that. 

Considering what he was working with as far as dialogue I think he played the role of Anakin very well  and particularly in ROTS. He creates a very believable transition to Vader.",277,1559,General Discussion,0.78,109,61,28718,7421,2019-12-19 00:37:31

I now want to go and see the rise of skywalker in cinemas with her but i am doughtfull as to what i should watch with her before we see the new one.
She has seen 1 or 2 episodes of Clone wars but thats it other than that she hasnt been in contact with any Star Wars media outside of the original triology. I grew up with the prequals and i dont hate them or love them really. I would like to show her more of Star Wars but i also feel like that the Prequels can destroy so much that makes Star Wars great. Like the mistery of the Force and the idea of Yoda being an all powerfull Jedi even without a Lightsaber. I think that in the prequels we see a lot of things that we actually maybe should have never seen. Like Darth Vader before he became one of the most Badass and threatening Villains of all Time.
I have asked her if she wants to watch the Prequels and she replied with ""yeah sure if you want to and think its a good idea"".

TLDR: just the Title

Edit: I asked her what she thinks allready  see the above text.",267,1332,Movies,0.84,4,8,316,1222,2019-12-19 17:30:12

267,"Revisiting Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (PC, Steam)","Have you had something you used to have a fond memory of when you were a childhood  cherished it for years until you revisited it recently and realized it was not good at all and your nostalgia was ruined? That was Shadows of the Empire for me.

Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire on N64 was the first video game I experienced when I was 2 or 3. It was the game that introduced me to what Star Wars was  which got me into watching movies as well. Every level of this game has been stuck in my brain more than I remember Ocarina of Time and Goldeneye. I have not revisited this memory until I bought the PC version from Steam.

To talk about the PC port first  it is horrible. While the graphics and the framerate are far better than the original N64 version  there was something about the CRT monitor that hid the primitive visual of the early 3D games. The framerate is tied to the game speed  which plays the game more than twice as fast as what the game is meant to be played. This makes the levels like the speeder bike and the turret sections outright unplayable. It makes me wonder if they ever playtested these levels. The controls are horrific with nonsensical keybindings and the vertical mouse movement controlling the player's walking speed like Doom. There is a glitch that did not exist in the original N64 version  where the player character just slips on uneven terrains and falls to death. This happens all the time in the platforming levels  which sucks all the enjoyment out. The FMV cutscenes look dated and every character looks like a plastic doll when the original N64 cutscenes had a gorgeous pixel-art illustration slideshow that worked around the limitation of the hardware. Compare [these two](https://youtu.be/lHUU15YRXyE?t=1918) [final cutscenes](https://youtu.be/6aFMsFdYCRw?t=9356) to each other  and judge which one has aged better. The PC port is hot garbage.

Regardless  the game itself was quite ambitious at the time. In 1996  there was rarely a game quite like Shadows of the Empire. It probably is one of the first 'cinematic' video games that are designed like theme parks built in the impressively high production quality with presenting the different gameplay scenarios while the narrative stringing together  later expanded in the games like Metal Gear Solid  Call of Duty  and Uncharted. Shadows of the Empire has three types of gameplay: The vehicle levels  on-foot levels  and turret levels. The problem with Shadows of the Empire is that due it being too ambitious for its time without any other game to base on  all of these three types are shallow at best and outright frustrating at worst.

The best out of three is the vehicle section. This is the groundbreaking Battle of Hoth  the speeder bike chase  and the Skyhook Battle. The Battle of Hoth was the level that probably convinced the players that the game is better than it actually is. It is the first introduction of the game and the best level out of all. This level is the first time that made the players felt they were playing a Star Wars movie. It is incredibly immersive  cinematic  and has some depths in gameplay. The player can engage the Imperial walkers in any way they want. You can clear out AT-STs first  or clear out the AT-ATs first by using the blaster cannons or the cable shots  which showcases the impressive visual fidelity at the time with the cinematic camera.

The speeder bike level is significantly weaker. While I do not think this is the worst level out of all unlike many people did  despite the horrible framerate speed issue on the PC one  I actually found it to be easier to control on the keyboard than the analog stick. The first half of the level where the player has to navigate around the maze-like town was infuriating  but once you get out of the town  the level gets a lot better as it becomes more of a racetrack. I rather take this over the on-foot levels and the turret levels.

The final Skyhook battle is the second-best level out of all with a sense of scale. It was the closet the player can taste of how the Second Death Star battle would play out in a video game. It is still shallow in comparison to Rogue Squadron and Starfighter  but it is still enjoyable. However  the first half involving the turret is garbage. 

Speaking of the turret levels  they are trash. You cannot avoid damage. Period. Especially on the PC version. The enemy fighters move so fast on the 60fps plus the bad mouse control that moves as if you are controlling an analog stick with a mouse makes this section punishing. There is nothing interesting set-piece or quirk to look at in these scenes  just empty voids with some asteroids flying around you.

The on-foot levels comprise most of the game and they are mostly not good. The highlights are the scrapyard level and the Imperial freighter level. The scrapyard level has you board on the train and ride in one seamless long blend technically impressive set-piece between the shootouts and the platforming  which probably have inspired the train levels in Red Dead Revolver and Uncharted 2. It is nailbiting to the end  and IG-88 is the best boss fight in the game and he has many interesting AI behaviors you can exploit. In the first half  he is basically the Terminator chasing after the player. IG-88 hits and runs instead of standing in one position. You are the prey and have to explore the level to run away. His mumbling voice straight out of the survival horror games was a literal nightmare fuel when I was a kid and still had a trauma about it  but it gives away his location. When you take out 50% of his health  the dynamic flips. IG-88 starts hiding  basically becoming the prey  and you become a hunter. You get a lot of different ways to fight him and it is one of the more advanced AI I have seen in the 90s games.

The Imperial freighter level is mostly a close-quarter combat area connected with many smaller rooms for the player to explore. It reminded me of Dark Forces levels  even down to the trash platforming section that ruins the pacing. The puzzle section is surprisingly well integrated into the level  where you have to flip out switches to make your path. It reminded me of Half-Life puzzles.

The best description of combat would be you are playing classic Resident Evil in the fully 3D environment with the camera always attached right behind the character and most enemies have guns who shoot the bullets within 0.5 seconds upon detecting you.

The aiming is automatic  but it is one of the weirdest auto-aim I have ever played. There is no crosshair  which confuses the player if the player's weapon is locked on which enemy or successfully locked on an enemy at all in the first place. When the player finds and locks an enemy  there is a weird delay when my weapon is pointing toward an enemy *slowly*. It is as if my blaster has become a tank cannon. It takes about a second to shoot at an enemy and when my weapon is fully ready to shoot  the enemy always shoots you first. Sometimes  the auto-aim just does not work at all. From what I played  it seems the horizontal aiming works relatively fine  but the vertical aiming is flat-out broken. Often time  the player cannot lock on enemies below you. Shooting during flying the jet-pack always shoots an inch down from the intended target while your target shoots at you in the perfect accuracy. 

This forces the player to engage in the manual vertical aiming  which stops the player and aim in the most uncomfortable mouse control I have ever experienced. The camera movement is clearly designed for the N64 analog stick. The camera system of most of the N64 games has you always revert to 'the default camera position' while you push your stick to temporarily look away from that default position. You will understand if you controlled the aiming system in Goldeneye. This just does not work on the mouse. If you try to manual aim  the camera reverts immediately to the default position. Apparently  whoever responsible for the PC port never thought to reprogram the basic camera control for the mouse. It is baffling. The messed-up manual aiming creates some sections in the game that were clearly designed for the player to use the manual aiming near-impossible. The Boba Fett boss fight and the final boss at the Xizor's Palace are optimized for the player to use this function. This  combined with the framerate speed issue  results in a horribly unbalanced combat system that is just not to fun at all.

There are other problems with the game. The enemy placements in this game are cheap. The player enters the elevator  waits for the lift to go up  and prepares for the enemy waiting for the player on the next floor... Then BOOM! You die because the door was actually behind you. Not even a chance for the player to retaliate. The wall turrets detect the player and leave no chance to avoid the blaster fires. Some levels are pitch-dark and literally nothing but a black void  especially in the Xizor's Palace. (Although this may be a fault of the PC version) Another problem is the lack of ammo for the player to prepare against the bosses. The bosses are bullet-sponges and trying to fight with the default blaster is a chore. The level designs are too simple and amateurish in comparison to the shooters that came out after or before. I played many better designed Doom wads that came out in the 90s.

The story feels... off. As if they wanted to tell a very broad and wide story  but lacks details and contexts. It is like all of your side characters get to do exciting things within this large story while you do chores and side-quests that are not important to the narrative. I am aware Shadows of the Empire was a multi-media project and requires to read the novel and the comicbooks if you want to know the story  but considering the goal of this game is to be a cinematic experience  I am disappointed how lackluster the narrative is.

I would not recommend Shadows of the Empire. It is only worth playing for the historical value  but playing it now was a frustrating experience. The production quality that made this game popular is gone with the time and immediately proceeded by other N64 games that came out directly afterward  such as Goldeneye  Metal Gear Solid  and Ocarina of Time  which offered better gameplay and expansive cinematic experiences. If you have to play the game  play the N64 original instead of the PC version.",1866,10426,Games,1.0,6,1,13620,56430,2019-12-19 16:15:27

270,Spoiler Theory for The Mandalorian (Chapters 7 and 8),"-Had to repost this due to some challenges with my spoiler tags

After watching Chapter 7 of the Mandalorian. something has been gnawing at me.  Most of my Star Wars theories prove to be totally wrong  so I don't see how this will be any different  but here's what I've picked up on so far.  

Potential spoilers for Mandalorian follow.

I believe that in Chapter 7  the Mandalorian was betrayed. And I'm pretty certain it was Cara Dune who did it.

Why do I think he was betrayed  and why by Cara?  Well....

I'm going to assume that Dr. Pershing  the Imperial doctor so interested in Baby Yoda  is sponsored by/reporting to Moff Gideon.  With that in mind  and with Gideon expressing how important Baby Yoda is to him  it stands to reason that both Gideon and Pershing share the belief that Baby Yoda must be captured alive.  We see that only the Client was willing to acquiesce and acquire it dead (for a lesser fee).

And yet  when the 'Client' reports that he has Baby Yoda with him  Moff Gideon challenges him on that immediately before having his Death Troopers blindly open fire into the bar.  That kind of indiscriminate attack does not befit a man going to such lengths to capture his very important target alive.

Gideon knew that Baby Yoda wasn't in that bar.  The imperial troopers don't seem to have tipped him off - they only zero in on the comms alerting them to Baby Yoda's location after the shootout started.  Greef likely didn't tip him off  he doesn't get what he wants by doing so and he already had his chance to betray the Mando but opted not to.  Kuiil was gunned down trying to escape.  IG-11 is unaccounted for  but there's no compelling reason we know of for him to assist the empire.

That leaves Cara.

When you suspect Cara and watch the episode again  there appears to be a lot of foreshadowing here: 

- We learn in this episode that there's no going back to the New Republic for her - they'll kill her or imprison her for life for the things she's done (so she might just have motivation to seek refuge with the imperial remnant instead).  
- We see the previously confident drop trooper acting very paranoid and on edge after agreeing to this mission  and only agreeing to it at all once she knows the empire is involved. 
- We see her attack Kuiil over his loyalties  which may just be a guilty conscience projecting onto this honorable Ugnaught. 
- And  most telling of all  we see Baby Yoda force choke her while arm wrestling with the Mandalorian: I believe Baby Yoda could sense the malice/betrayal of her true plans  saw the physical struggle  and was pushed to defend the Mandalorian  only for everyone else to think it was all a misunderstanding.  I don't think it was a misunderstanding at all though.

So yes  I am starting to suspect it is quite possible that Cara betrayed the Mandalorian.",503,2836,Spoilers,1.0,6,5,102853,7321,2019-12-19 17:07:38
271,I‚Äôm hesitantly optimistic about Rise of Skywalker.,"I love me some Star Wars.  I‚Äôm sure you do  too.

The Mandalorian has added a new tone to the franchise that makes me excited for future content from Jon Favreau.

The reviews have me concerned about the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga.  I don‚Äôt know anything going in.  Haven‚Äôt read leaks  save for that they are true.

I get that people did not like Last Jedi.  I‚Äôve seen it at least six or seven times now  and I like it more with every viewing. I‚Äôm told because I like TLJ I will not like Rise of Skywalker.

I‚Äôm an unorthodox Star Wars fan  and I tend to look past preconceptions and try to just enjoy the ride with these films  so despite the negative reviews  despite the criticisms of what was leaked  I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll have a good time tonight and be satisfied that Star Wars is still a world I can escape into going forward.

May the Force be with you  everyone. Shout out if you have a positive mindset going in and are ready to enjoy a fun two and a half hour roller coaster of laser swords and levitation with space monsters and heroes.

279,"So, the journey ends.","This week marks the release of the final main Star Wars film.  This week  the Skywalker Trilogy end.  As it was with the prequels  there has been much hate.  But  let us remember one thing about these movies  whether good or bad.

*Star Wars* was never expected to make it this far.

*Star Wars* was never expected to get this big.

Way back when George Lucas created the original idea  no one wanted it.  United Artists  Universal and even Disney all passed on *Star Wars*.  The only reason Fox even took the chance on this film was because George Lucas had received an Oscar nomination for *American Graffiti*.  Lucas agreed to a lower fee  and an $8 million budget as long as he kept the merchandise rights and the rights to the sequels.  Fox agreed because they had no faith in the movie and did not see potential for a sequel.  They had no faith in this strange movie that combined sci-fi and fantasy  They agreed to this so that the next *American Graffiti* George Lucas did would land on their doorstep.

This is regarded as the biggest mistake any studio has ever made.  This is the reason why not studio since then will ever give up merchandising or sequel rights.

The film cost $11 million to make  going over budget.  There were production issues.  Brand new special effects had to be invented to make a lot of the action sequences work.  When John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra were chosen for the music  people thought Lucas was crazy.  No one did a classical style soundtrack to a sci-fi movie.

Fox chose to release the in a limited release in May  because people did not go to movies in May.

On May 25th  1977  *Star Wars* was released.

On May 25th  1977  a movie was released that slammed into popular culture with the kind of force that could only be equated to the Death Star destroying Alderaan.

The movie cost $11 million to make.

It made $775.4 million.

Today  the franchise that Fox never thought was going to exist is worth billions. *Star Wars* is the most successful independent film of all time and holds the *Guinness* world record for the ""most successful film merchandising franchise"" at $30 billion.

Fox was nearly bankrupted before this movie came out.  After that day  their stock soared and they began to become the media conglomerate they are today.

The impact of *Star Wars* has been felt in film  with Hollywood moving away from just making deep and meaningful stories full of drama  conflict and irony to actually making movies that are just fun to watch.  Special effects became a respected art form and a big part of movies because *Star Wars* changed the game.  How films are scored changed  because Star Wars has one of the greatest and most recognizable soundtracks of all time.  People have joined the London Symphony Orchestra because it is the orchestra that brought that music to life.  Jedi is an actual religion.  Star Wars even found its way into politics and sports.  Alongside Jaws  Star Wars created the summer blockbuster.

It combined sci-fi  fantasy  storytelling  world building with great music and dazzling special effects to create something wonderful and amazing.  The galaxy these films created is as revered and as beloved as Middle Earth and Narnia.  The characters created are as popular now as they were when we first saw them.  

Like the Force  Star Wars unites us  binds and penetrates us  because something about it speaks to you.  And yes  like the Force  there is a light and a dark side to the fandom  but we are all fans.   Regardless of race  creed  color or country  we are Star Wars fans.  I don't care if that thing is a desert scavenger  a farm boy  a smuggler  space Jesus  an adorable meme machine  or a ship  something about these films spoke to you  brought you to the fandom and made you part of something so much bigger than anyone ever thought it would be.

I honestly believe that ""A long  long  time ago in a galaxy far  far away..."" has inspired as many  if not more than ""Once upon a time.""

*Star Wars* is not just a movie.  It is a culture.  It is mythology that we will pass to our children  and they will pass on to their children  and so on.

And it is insane to think that this is a phenomenon that no one thought would happen  or that would ever get as big as it has.

As we come to the end of the Skywalker saga  the last of the main Star Wars films  I would like to say  to all those who made it possible  to George Lucas  to John Williams  the the cast and the crew  to 20th Centruy Fox and  yes  even Disney  I want to say thank you.

282,Do what I did to deal with the disappointment:,"Simply disconsider the new trilogy to be part of the canon. Just like how Disney did to the EU. You won't believe how easily it will manage to smooth out your frustration and anger. 

The new trilogy  in my eyes  was one large fanboy fan fiction story. And people called Solo unneccesary and bad. Boy oh boy. Taking the new trilogy remotely serious  especially compared to the previous movies  will only bloat your feelings with bad vibes. People who liked/enjoyed the new trilogy are free to do so. For me  as a Star Wars fan  I instead would've prefered to never see another new SW movie in my life  would I have known what the new trilogy would do to massacre everything we have seen and known so far.

Disney ruined it. I learned from them. I do not consider these last 3 films to be canon. They will be forgotten  not only by myself  but most likely by everyone else who has seen them. Time will prove that. At least the actors and special effects department  who did a good/OK job  will use these movies as a carreer boost.

>!...The Rise Of Skywalker has really left me with a strong sense of sadness. Which shouldn't be that way right? I mean  the big fight that has been going on since 1977 (in real time) has been won  the sith are destroyed  rey and (almost all of) her friends live and all that good stuff. But still  the ending really saddens me. And even though I get that killing of Ben Solo in the story was necessary for the Skywalker Bloodline to end and for him to make the ultimate sacrifice to show that he is truly redeemed - I am really upset that he didn't get to live. Rey and him clearly had a connection that was strong like none other  and they don't get to be together in the end. And even though it's also really sad that we will not see these great characters again (most likely) I wouldn't be that sad if they would have ended the rey/ben relationship in a more satisfying way...but maybe i have to watch it a few more times. I have watched TROS for the second time today and - while it's flaws were more visible the second time around - it is a really fun and exciting movie and beautifully made.!<",217,1133,spoilers,1.0,2,2,500,1921,2019-12-19 21:44:36

288,[NO SPOILERS] Question about Kylo and Rey in TLJ and moving forward,"Finished my re-watch and while I don't want to discuss the quality of any of the movies including TLJ I do have a question about Rey and Kylo force timing. Is there any reason to believe that this bond will continue moving forward?

I am really paranoid about spoilers and have been trying to stay off the internet but this is something I'm very curious about as we approach Rise of Skywalker. In the movie Snoke states that he was able to join their minds however at the end of the movie they do share a final moment after Snoke is dead. 

Seems like the way it works now is like a phone call and there has to be a level of consent from both sides for them to be able to communicate. Personally I want it to continue and for them to use it as a weapon against each other or at the very least to add more wrinkles in the story. Maybe an unpopular opinion but I find the two sides of the same coin dynamic between the two compelling.

Either way I'm excited to see this trilogy end and can't wait to finally see Rise of Skywalker tonight.",202,1037,,1.0,4,6,51654,150,2019-12-19 17:52:32

290,Opinion on Force Awakens,I know lots of people are very split on the sequel trilogy and even myself especially disliked TLJ  but as far as force awakens goes a lot of people agree that it‚Äôs too similar to a new hope.

293,I may be looking too far into this but...,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




With Rey being Palpatine's granddaughter  let's break it down. Palpatine is stated to have been born in 84bby on Naboo  making him 119 years old at the time of Episode IX. Rey is stated to have been born in 15aby  making her 20 years old in Episode IX. 

To make more sense of this I've converted the Star Wars timeline to our own timeline  say Episode IX takes place in 2019. This means Rey was born in 1999 and Palpatine in 1900. Does anyone else think he is ridiculously old to be her Grandfather? Rey's parents only looked 30 ish in the vision so was he impregnating whoever the poor soul was in his 70's? This is after he had already been scarred and deformed ahaha (He was 65 in Revenge of the Sith). Who knows  do you know JJ?",140,878,Spoilers,0.67,3,9,93,412,2019-12-19 16:33:16

296,As someone who grew up with the prequels around the time Revenge of the Sith was coming out I can't stand how this trilogy has absolutely murdered the legacy of my boy Anakin.,"Anakin Skywalker  The chosen one. The one who was told to bring balance to the force and \*did\*. George Lucas has always said Star Wars is about the story of Anakin Skywalker and his redemption and growing up he was always my favorite character. He was cool  powerful  sly but most of all human  and his arc was what made Star Wars perfect. I mean it was PERFECT.  I remember seeing my first in theater star wars film(episode 3) and all the toys and games coming out around that time. It was such a great time to be alive and just thinking back to those times with all the packaging and nostalgia makes me smile. But even as kids my friends and I recognized the complexities of Star Wars characters and their relationships within the plot. The entire plot across 6 films (even though some people didnt like the execution of the prequels) was thought out and it had meaning because it was made to be that way. Anakin was seduced by the dark side  he made a grave mistake and then ultimately redeemed himself in the end with the help of his son tying up the prophecy that was fortold in the very beginning. That final moment when Anakin comes back to the light by defeating Sideous once and for all is one of the most satisfying endings to a saga ever because there is so much emotion built up within all of the characters stories and it is truely meant to be the fitting resolution to the original conflict...

Until Now.

I seriously cannot comprehend what this sequel trilogy has done to such a perfectly written story. You could have written this trilogy a million different ways without ever stomping on absolutely EVERY major success that the original 6 films have made and somehow this trilogy seems to pick the absolute worst possible route for every decision. After knowing what route episode 9 takes I am just sitting here stunned. But I cant even be pissed anymore  just dissapointed. Its acutally laughable how bad this is. The skywalkers are ALL dead  Rey takes his name cause fuckin why not  Palpatine came back somehow without being explained  almost every issue from TLJ is explained with some sort of quick fix cop out because the writers didnt acutally PLAN anything  somehow kylo can bring people back from the dead  kylo and rey are in love for some fuckin reason  etc etc I mean theres just absolutely no consistency. It's \*Garbage\*

But the worst of all? It ruined what Star Wars was actually about. The struggle of a single man who made an awful series of mistakes but learned how to find his way again and brought balance to his world. That whole lesson of redemption and everything he went through to get there means nothing. Absolutely nothing. Because literally everything that was resolved was undone only to be resolved again for no fuckin reason other than to make Rey look cool.

Since I don‚Äôt want to experience 2 hours of confusion tomorrow  I thought I‚Äôd ask Reddit users to give me a short summary of what happened so far?

Who are the main characters?
What‚Äôs the overall plot and setting?
Are the movies chronological?
What will the movie I‚Äôm gonna watch be about?
Anything else I should definitely know before tomorrow?

Lots can change in one movie. Some folks seem to think that TLJ dug too deep a hole for JJ to fix but I am more optimistic.

304,The only review that matters: I just went to see TROS with twelve year old me....my daughter,"\[no spoilers\]

I was about eight years old when Return of the Jedi came out and I wouldn't be on this subreddit 38 years later if I didn't fall in love with it then. Collected action figures as a kid  rewatched the trilogy on VHS a million times and fought lots of lightsaber battles with my best friend in my back yard. 

Grew up  went to college got a job and found my true love. Saw the prequels and had my opinions about them but bought all the DVD none the less and secretly loved them. I became a father  watched the sequels and had my opinions again about how they were great or sucked at the same time.

So I was a little anxious toninght to see TROS. It could only dissapoint  couldn't it?

But tonight I went to see it with my twelve year old daughter who saw a couple of the episodes (at least 7 & 8) and something happened. She started crying at the end. She was overwhelmed by emotions  about everything and with tears in her eyes she called this the best movie she had ever seen. And there I was again  an eight year version of me after seeing Return of the jedi  crying out of pure joy and sadness  all emotions possible about what I had just experienced. 

It doesn't matter what critics think. It doesn't matter what 44 year old grumpy old men on reddit like me think. What matters is what twelve year old you would feel after seeing this and my twelve year old will never be the same after this movie  that's for sure. 

Tonight I was eight again. Thank you Star Wars  on behalf of me and my daughter.",291,1521,,0.78,126,37,28161,562,2019-12-18 22:49:39

I like a lot of the ideas the film explores and the character growth between Luke  Rey and Ben is really great. However  the entire arc of Finn and Poe still has me a bit confused. It seems like their entire subplot was made invalid by the time Poe discovered Holdo's plan. (why didn't she tell him?) Poe seemed to constantly make foolish decisions that were avoidable if he had information that was withheld from him. 

And Finn  I really love the potential for his character  but I'm a bit lost on where he's at or why he's making his decisions. I originally thought he and Rey were both force sensitive which was the reason for him not wanting to fight. I thought maybe he'd be a character searching for true peace  but it seems like he wants to fight  just for the other guys. But then there's the whole bit with DJ and telling him not to join a side? I know this entire section of the movie is to help these characters grow and realize things  but I think I'm missing what their purpose is? 

I'm reaching out to try to better understand these characters moving forward because like I said  I enjoy the movie and would like to understand the entirety of it if possible.",232,1259,General Discussion,0.6,2,5,29427,556,2019-12-19 16:50:36

351,Before Going into The Rise of Skywalker,"I guess im just curious what everyone is hoping for most from Rise of Skywalker  their favorite moments from the past 8 films  their favorite star wars memory  and how they feel about the films prior to episode 9.
For me I‚Äôm really hoping for some force ghosts (especially Anakin) and having a really epic finale that ties everything together.
My favorite moments from the saga so far have to be Anakin and Obi-Wan‚Äôs duel. Luke and Vader‚Äôs duel from rotj and Vader‚Äôs redemption. Finn and Poe‚Äôs escape from tfa. And the duel of fates.
My favorite moment is easily when i was in kindergarden i saw my grandmas dvd for aotc and asked her what it was. She told me it was star wars and for the rest of the week we watched all 6 movies over the course of 3 days and it changed my life forever.
I really love every single film and i really feel like the new film could be the best yet. My order from best to least favorite as of now is 6 1 3 2 4 5 7 8 (yeah i really like the prequels) I just really hope we can all celebrate the saga we all love and even if there are films we don‚Äôt care for we can all respect each other‚Äôs opinions and find the joy in the parts we love most.",234,1170,Movies,0.75,2,17,457,8549,2019-12-19 19:19:38

 - Leia's CGI role   
 - Lando didn't do shit    
 - D-0    

Hated   

 - Jesus christ the movie is fast. Kylo in the forest killing people and finding the wayfinder  travelling to exogol  talking to the emperor  all the star destroyers (time = less than 7 minutes)    

 - How convenient everything is. Every time they don't have a way out or have a new challenge  someone has a perfect solution for it.   

 - Emperor is trash in this movie   

 - It made the first 6 movies unnecessary    

 - All the Reylo shit     

 - Kylo's arc    

 - Rey Skywalker  easily the thing I most hate about this movie. Not only all skywalkers are dead  the last person alive carrying the name skywalker is a palpatine. She should have jumped out of a cliff and end this shit for good.",147,900,Spoilers,0.59,7,12,26582,15165,2019-12-19 11:26:54

362,Star Wars: The Last Jedi Review,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi Review (Spoilers)

Written By: Finian Dougherty

*Star Wars: The Last Jedi* by Rian Johnson is not what you think the sequel to *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* would be at all. Rian took the story that JJ Abrahms started in The Force Awakens  and steered it down a different path. Whether it‚Äôs the right path  well that‚Äôs up to you and your judgement.

One of the many problems people have with *The Last Jedi* is the comedy. Right away  we see the Resistance trying to flee from the First Order‚Äôs grasp. Dialogue is exchanged between General Hux and Poe Dameron that is meant to be funny  but is forced and may have too much of a modern tone. Even so  I personally enjoyed this moment as within the context of the current situation  it works because the Resistance needs Poe to buy time for them to finish the evacuation and make the jump to hyperspace.¬†

Another scene that is played off as a comedic moment is when Luke milks a creature on the planet of Ahch-To  which I didn‚Äôt mind as the scene only lasted about five seconds. The comedy in this movie is different compared to the comedy in the other Star Wars films  it‚Äôs not as subtle  which is why I like it.

Another problem people have with the film is how Luke treats his lightsaber that he had lost in *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back*. The Force Awakens established that there was a significant importance to the Skywalker lightsaber as it called to Rey  which further led to the awakening of her force powers. When we pick up where we left off at the very end of The Force Awakens  Rey is handing what we find out to be broken and distraught Luke Skywalker the Skywalker lightsaber. We see Luke holding the lightsaber and then tossing it over his shoulder  walking out of shot. To many fans  this was a slap in the face to all the fans‚Äô theories and efforts to figure out what Luke‚Äôs reaction would be to seeing not only his lost lightsaber  but this girl that‚Äôs found him after all this time. I was definitely surprised at what Luke did  but I didn‚Äôt feel the same way many of the fans did. This is an example of how I feel with pretty much all the twists that this movie has  I almost appreciate them in their own way for being different and most importantly  fresh.¬†

The twist that probably shook the fandom‚Äôs and my viewing experience the most  was the death of Supreme Leader Snoke. Everyone  including myself  thought we would learn who Snoke is  where he came from  and how he came into power to be the supreme leader of the First Order that reigns over the galaxy. This is why his death was the ultimate twist  as Kylo Ren uses the force to turn the Skywalker Lightsaber and ignite it through his greatest enemy  Snoke. I‚Äôve said this before and I‚Äôll say it again  I think seeing Snoke‚Äôs death on the movie screen is cinematically the greatest scene I‚Äôve experienced. The same can‚Äôt be said for a lot of the fandom though  as the questions they had towards Snoke weren‚Äôt answered at all  as they immediately faded away when he died.¬†

All of these examples I‚Äôve given and explained is why this movie is so polarizing within casual and hardcore fans. I personally believe this movie is one of the best in the entire saga  despite some people‚Äôs distaste for it. I‚Äôm definitely the type of person that will watch any Star Wars film and enjoy it from start to finish. I‚Äôll have questions and even some issues with certain movies  but as a whole I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to hate a Star Wars film.¬†

I enjoy *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*  The special effects  the sounds  and just the visuals in general were absolutely stunning in my opinion. It‚Äôs going to be difficult for future Star Wars films to outdo *The Last Jedi* when it comes to those aspects.¬†",689,3752,,0.57,2,1,115,38,2019-12-19 18:49:44

The two episodes she directed for The Mandalorian are the best (so far) and she gets it  she knows how to set up the mood  the pace  the way she directs the actors and the scenes as well as using the proper inspirations and not make it obvious.

I'm currently skeptical about Star Wars in the large screen because while I greatly enjoyed the current one  I'm aware of its polarizing reception so if Disney ever decided to do a 3rd trilogy  which they'll probably will  please get Deborah Chow to helm it because she has it.

373,Palpatine's return and Anakin's prophecy,"I'm not a fan of the prequels  but I did find it clever that Anakin was prophesied to destroy the Sith and ended up fulfilling that prophecy in a way nobody would have expected. He became the Sith and then later destroyed the Sith in ROTJ.  Anakin killing Palpatine fulfilled the prophecy.

Now it seems  through the reviews of ROS  that Palpitatine either never died or is risen from the dead. If he never died that seems to render the prophecy moot and pointless  invalidating what Lucas thought was an important aspect to Anakin's presence in the Skywalker saga.  If he died and was resurrected  to me at least that diminishes it.

I guess I don't have much stake in preserving the continuity of the prequels since I didn't like them  but it does seem to render the whole thing pointless about and Anakin's importance in bringing balance to the Force. 

I haven't seen ROS so I can't say for sure if they even bother to address this but I guess I'll find out.",174,962,General Discussion,0.75,2,18,1452,7371,2019-12-19 18:28:29

I had a feeling the movie was rushed as in the second half of the movie  things went a lot quicker. The special effects and emotional moments were great  although I would've liked it if the emotional moments would've gotten more time to breathe and expand. What's your opinion?

384,My ode to Star Wars. Hope you guys enjoy!,"Everyone has something of theirs that was their favorite growing up. A favorite toy  game  movie  TV series...the list goes on and on. Most people tend to hold a soft spot for those things or maybe get lucky enough to hold on to them forever. Star Wars has been all of that for me and then some. 

Ever since I was introduced to this world at 9 years old  it‚Äôs been my escape. I‚Äôll never forget the rush I felt after watching Episode IV for the first time. I was the most unathletic kid of the neighborhood ‚ÄúFirst Street Gang‚Äù but nobody‚Äôs bicycle went faster that day. In my mind  it was an X-Wing and I was ready to take on the Empire. Luke Skywalker showed me on that Sunday afternoon that I can do anything  anyone can be a hero  and it‚Äôs a message that‚Äôs stuck with me through the years  even to this very day. In the highest of highs  the lowest of lows  and everywhere in between  Star Wars has always been there for me.

I‚Äôm 24 now and eventually  you sort of outgrow these things. Not entirely  but nothing lasts forever  especially those favorite things from yesteryear. As the Skywalker saga comes to a close  it feels like goodbye in a way. Not in the sense that I can‚Äôt ever watch these movies again  or that they‚Äôll ever stop making them  but it‚Äôs time for a new generation to enjoy them as much as I did. To pass it on to the kids of today and those of the future  like any good Jedi would  so they can love and cherish it too.

Thank you to George Lucas  Kathleen Kennedy  Lawrence Kasdan  JJ Abrams  Rian Johnson  Mark Hamill  Carrie Fisher  and all the other actors  writers  directors  etc. who brought this universe to life. You all created something that gave me sunlight on cloudy days  hope when it was needed most  and reminded me to never  ever stop dreaming. Again  thank you all.

When the final trailer released a while back  it brought tears to my eyes. It reminded me of a group of young boys in Grapevine  Kentucky playing with their toy lightsabers and believing they were Jedi Knights  fighting the good fight to restore peace to the galaxy. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôll remember this saga most and my ultimate hope is that Star Wars will forever inspire children across the world  like it did myself and so many others.

God bless that galaxy far  far away and may the Force be with us all.",431,2311,,0.67,1,0,1577,767,2019-12-19 21:54:25

I genuinely love the Sequel Movies TFA reignited my love for star wars in a time when I started to fall off and TLJ was such a cool direction and experience in the series for me  but as the years went by I saw the fandom and youtubers and reviewers all turn on this franchise and hate on it to a degree where it really made me feel like how can anyone be so hateful and so hyperbolic and just plain mean. 

I will concede yes you dont have to love the sequels and you can even be critical of them or even nitpick. But the hate and disrespect I seen everywhere and the divide of fans of star wars makes me so sad and upset to be a fan or rather part of such a fandom.

420,Thoughts on Star Wars after latest Mandalorian episode,"Two things to start off  first I love trying to think about how fantasy and so fi tech and situations could happen in real life.  and second  I‚Äôve always struggled just a bit with droids in the Star Wars universe. They seem to straddle the line between being creations who must act on its programming  and sentient technology with emotions  attachments and maybe even morality. Especially in a few events in the legends timeline  or in Solo.  I guess a big part of me wants them to pick a side  even though another part of me also enjoys it at times.   
So this brings me to the latest episode of the mandalorian. There‚Äôs a montage where this droid is trying to relearn to walk and perform other functions. It reminded me very much of the process humans go through after big injuries of having to relearn basic motor skills. So my first thought was that this was humanizing the droid and leaning more towards the sentient side of Star Wars droids. But as I thought about it I started thinking about how it could also be a barebones AI starting from scratch and self adjusting code and creating new stuff in order to learn new skills and fine tune them. 

Also unrelated side note: I find it interesting how the mandalorian is kinda normalizing some potentially controversial ideas created in recent Star Wars lore.  At least it looks like they might be. Like droid rights are kinda being explored with Mando‚Äôs droid racism. Or force powers potentially being innate might be explored with the baby yoda. I would find it interesting if they‚Äôre trying to re-approach those ideas in a way that may be more palatable to some fans than the previous attempts.",294,1652,Spoilers,0.7,4,6,8289,647,2019-12-19 11:56:40

I am kinda sad it ended. I will never forget my experience watching it with my dad when I was 12. Watching all the stars war films at home at the time. Anyway I wanted to ask some questions about the film due to the fact that I was confused on some bit.

- Is Rey and Kylo Ren related? 
- Why does she have that orange lightsaber?? 
- Is Rey some how related to the Skywalker? 
- Are Rey parents related to the force?
- How is that girl (I forgot her name) related to Lando Calrission? I thought she was a clone? 

Those are my main questions for now. I might ask more in the comments. 

Also I have to admit the film was a bit terrible especially with Kylo Ren's death  there could have been different ways on how to defeat Palpatine  how the hell did Kylo Ren get to Exogol without the navigation?  and just how can Rey take the Skywalker's name? Anyway please don't get offended by this rant its just my personal opinion.

The newly named Finn is not elated about shooting down TIE fighters  he hesitates  knowing that the pilots were once brainwashed children just as he was. This hesitation almost gets them shot down but at a critical moment he fires back  though he is clearly shaken by the act of killing his previous comrades.¬†


He hides these emotions from Rey and is genuinely elated that they managed to escape and is impressed with her flying skills.¬†


The film continues as we saw it up until just after the conversation between Kylo  Hux and Snoke. In this version it is not revealed that Kylo is Han and Leia's son  merely that Kylo must destroy all that oppose the first order to complete his training. Hux is of the opinion that Star Killer base is not fully ready for operation and that his men need more time. Snoke insists a trial of the weapon. As Hux bows and walks away  we see a look of resentment on his face.¬†


Aboard the Falcon  Han explains why Luke is missing  that Kylo Ren  one of his students  betrayed and destroyed his new order of Jedi. Snoke  the leader of the newly emerged First Order  created from the remnants of a scattered Empire  seduced and manipulated Kylo Ren. Snoke had slowly been gathering young impressionable force sensitives from across the Galaxy and formed the Knights of Ren  a fanatical cult of Dark Side users.¬†


Han explains that Snoke sent visions of betrayal and distrust into the young Kylo's mind as he slept  sewing seeds of hatred against his teacher. We see flashbacks of Kylo's visions over Han's narration. Snoke showed Kylo a corrupted version of events  Luke murdering a defenseless Emperor and turning on his on his own father. He claimed that Luke would murder him as well  when Kylo's powers became too strong to control.¬†


It is not fully revealed how the new Jedi order was actually destroyed at this point. Han looks sorrowful  with Finn and Rey exchanging glances to imply they haven't heard the full story.¬†


Han says that after the order fell  Luke went into exile  saying that he would find the very first Jedi Temple. He believed it held the key to finding true balance within the force and would allow him to free Kylo Ren of Snoke's influence. Luke never returned  and most believe he simply gave up. Finn asks why they would even bother trying to help Kylo  to which Han seems as though he's about to say something  but pauses to think. He then remarks  ""Luke always saw the good in everyone. Maybe it's his greatest flaw.""


The crew travel to Takodana  where Han believes someone may know how to restore BB8's incomplete map to the Jedi Temple. After a disagreement with Finn  Rey is called to the vault where she finds Luke's original blue Lightsaber that once belonged to Anakin. Upon picking it up  she has a vision: she sees Luke crouched in front of the burning Jedi Temple  the knights of Ren and Kylo in the rain  long corridors and cold forests. Everything becomes dark and she finds herself face to face with Kylo. She recoils in terror and falls backwards  ending the vision.¬†


Finn feels a strange sensation while trying to barter passage on a ship and looks confused. He too feels drawn to the vault and hurries towards the stairs. Maz tries to calm a shaken and disturbed Rey  who flees and bumps into Finn on her way out. Before they can talk  Han interrupts them  saying it's time to leave. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber that Rey threw back in the box and tells him to take care of it and give it to Rey when the time feels right.¬†


General Hux makes his speech and fires up Starkiller base. We see a close up of him  his eyes slightly watering and an expression of hatred on his face.¬†


The heroes leave the bar just in time to see Starkiller destroy Hosnian Prime and its entire fleet. The base was supposed to be capable of destroying multiple planets but due to Hux's warning of it not being ready  is only able to destroy one.¬†


As the heroes look on in horror  the first order attacks Takodana. They are separated during the fight and Rey is chased into the woods by Kylo Ren. She struggles to fend him off with her blaster as he effortlessly subdues and captures her.¬†


When Finn once again is hesitant to engage Storm Troopers  Han urges him fight. Reluctantly  Finn uses the Lightsaber when Maz points out its his only weapon. TR8R faces Finn down with his stun baton  calling Finn a traitor. Finn fights back but is outmatched. Chewie saves Finn with his Bowcaster and Finn picks up the Stun Baton and shield. He continues to fight  taking down Troopers with non lethal means.


Poe and the resistance arrive to engage the FO. Leia and Han have their reunion. They embrace and Han says after what he has seen  he doesn't believe things can be fixed.¬†


Rey attempts to resist Kylo's interrogation and manages to reverse the probe through willpower and viewed as a flashback she sees Snoke torturing Kylo during his training  the flash of a green lightsaber and Kylo unmasked  viewed from behind  silhouetted against a burning Jedi Temple.¬†


She comes out of the memories  calling Kylo a creature in a mask. Kylo unmasks himself  revealed not to be scarred or deformed as Rey expected  but just a young man. After he leaves and talks to Snoke about her power  Snoke orders her to be brought before him. Kylo orders Rey's guards to bring her to them. Rey pretends to be unconscious as they take off her restraints and springs into action as soon as she is free  using her self taught survival skills to combat the surprised Storm Troopers.¬†


Stealing a weapon and her belongings  she escapes as she did in the film. Kylo is alerted and Snoke voices his disappointment.¬†


Han  Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base as they did in the original film and encounter Phasma as they turn a corner. A small firefight ensues in which Finn fights Phasma one on one while Han and Chewie engage her personal guards. Phasma badly beats Finn and is about to finish him when Chewie comes to the rescue  picking her up and ripping off her arm. Badly injured  the trio threaten her into deactivating the shields  after which she shoulder barges Finn to escape and throws herself down a trash compactor shoot.¬†


Han's death follows a similar structure to the original film  however this is where we first learn that Kylo is infact Ben Solo  the son of Han and Leia.


The film continues as normal right up until the forest fight. As Ben increases his Dark Side strength by punching his Wound  Finn turns to Rey and gives her the Lightsaber  telling her that this must be why she is supposed to have it. Finn readies his shield and stun baton and charges Ben  engaging him in combat. Rey musters the courage to ignite the Saber  running to join Finn.¬†


They both fight Ben together  though even injured they are no match for him. After a skirmish  he brutally slashes Finn's back. Rey becomes enraged and manages to slash his face  leaving a searing wound. He chokes and throws Rey across the forest and into a tree  knocking her out. He retrieves his family lightsaber with the force  feeling its power resonate through him. As he prepares to finish Rey and Finn the planet surface cracks open  separating them. Rey recovers as Chewie arrives to carry an unconscious Finn. As they depart  she turns around on the Falcon's door platform  locking eyes with Ben.¬†


Snoke orders a panicking Hux to retrieve the wounded Kylo and bring him to his ship. Ben's rage is wearing off and his wounds now begin to take a toll. He stumbles back to the main base and passes out as Hux and a dirty  trash compactor damaged Phasma are evacuating. Hux contemplates leaving Ben  but has him dragged by Storm Troopers on his transport.¬†


The resistance and First Order evacuation both escape as the planet explodes.¬†


Later  on D'Qar  Leia hugs a mournful Chewie before seeing to Rey and an unconscious Finn. Rey tells her that she felt the force at her side in the forest and on Takodana. Leia says she must find Luke and train in the ways of the Jedi if she wishes to truly help the resistance. R2  laying in low power mode overhears this and becomes active. He tells Leia that Luke ordered him to hide his location until he either returned or a new hope was found in the Galaxy. R2 reveals the missing map piece to the first Jedi Temple. Leia gives Rey her lightsaber that she once constructed  telling her she was Luke's first student  but she gave up that path when Ben was born. It's now time for Rey to pick up where Leia left off.¬†


Rey arrives on Acht-To to find Luke watching over the horizon and hands him Leia's lightsaber as a token of trust. The scene pans out on the island.

Grievous using Anakin's hilt for one of his sabers isn't a continuity error: He just found one of Anakin's many cast-offs.

Maz Kanata didn't need to hunt down the saber lost in Cloud City. Someone simply stumbled upon another of Anakin's lost sabers. That's why Luke so flippantly tossed it. He recognized that it wasn't even the same saber he had used and lost all those years ago.

Hell  it's even possible that the one Luke had wasn't even the one Obi-Wan picked up from the lava bed. As far as we know  Obi-Wan had a small box full of Anakin's lightsabers that he had been collecting over the years.",154,861,General Discussion,0.6,3,2,297998,24373,2019-12-19 10:43:13

Or that ""Skywalker"" could become a name of hope for the entire galaxy and the Mantra for a new Jedi Order valuing peace by accepting the dark side as a natural thing symbolised by Kylo and Rey  remember?

491,Star Wars: A History of Me,"
I was about 10 years old when my dad told me to watch Star Wars. He told me to watch episode four then watch five and six. The problem was the video store that had the movies never had five in so I watched only four and six. I had a super Nintendo video game but that wasn‚Äôt the same. Then one day for my birthday I got the complete series and you know what I loved it. I became a huge Star Wars fan and as a result are you up watching every Star Wars movie with my uncle who is another huge Star Wars fan.

I collected Legos  I bought the comics  bought several special editions.  It‚Äôs all culminating in the final movie tomorrow and I could not be any more excited. It‚Äôs been approximately 20 years since I got my first Star Wars Lego set. It‚Äôs been nearly 20 years since I got the OG Star Wars trilogy. I am so proud to be a Star Wars fan sometimes and other days I‚Äôm not but I am so happy to see that so many of us are excited for what‚Äôs about to transpire.

Yes I read the leaks but there‚Äôs a difference between reading leaks and watching it on the screen. I know that this will be one of the most explosive movies of the year primarily for reasons we probably won‚Äôt talk about here but this is the end of the year and we‚Äôre heading out with a bang.

492,"To me, the new trilogy isn't cannon","I love Star Wars too much to let this new trilogy destroy it for me. I think the whole thing is basically just trash besides some of TFA. I grew up worshiping the OT  reading the expanded universe novels  playing games like X-Wing Vs. Tie Fighter and Shadows of the Empire  buying the toys  heck I even liked the prequels mostly. 

As soon as I saw TLJ I decided that  in my mind  the new trilogy would be like some alternate universe kind of thing  and the real sequels would be the Thrawn trilogy and all the incredible expanded material. This new movie just put the nail in the coffin.

497,"(Spoilers for TRoS) List of connections between TRoS and Dark Empire, Legacy War, and other Legends material.","Right now if you told me that JJ Abrams had never read Dark Empire or even been told the plot of it I would have a hard time believing that. Yes a infinite amount of monkeys on typewriters can create a Shakespeare play but at this point some of the same beats and tropes are just being used to amazing degrees. So I want to take the time to list down all of the connections between the RoS and the comics and books of the EU. If anyone wants to add on to this then come on. But be warned for spoilers. 

* The Emperor Reborn- This one is the very first thing to jump off the page. In this movie the Emperors spirit is possessing a body that is kept alive or called back to life by the use of Sith Alchemy instead of just transferring his soul into another body

*Soul Transfer-  Speaking of transferring his soul just like he wanted to transfer his soul into baby Anakin Solo because his body was dying he wants Rey to kill him so that he and the spirits of all the sith lords inside of him can live on in her

* Sith Spirits surviving after death- This has already been seen in the NEU in things like Momin but its here as well. Also interstingly their was a fantheory that Darth Bane moved his spirit into Zannah and all Sith were just bane. It was debunked in Legends but here its kind of true. 

*Force Storms- Here its not a giant wormhole but just really powerful lightning that goes into the sky and ends up taking out the fleet.  He can also use it to attack places on other planets hes not currently on as seen in RoK comic. To top it off in DE I he is defeated by having his force storm redirected back at him. The same thing happened here in this movie. 

* Force Sensitive Clones- Really this falls more under the Thrawn Trilogy but we lean in this movie that force users can be cloned. In fact Snoke was a clone. 

*Puppeting someone with the force- While we are diverging from DE for a second I should mention Palpatine controlling Snoke from a distance with the force. This is much like the Sith Emperor in SWTOR. 

* Star Destroyers with Death Star lasers- In DE it was the Eclipse SSD but their was also a topps card that had a ISD with a scaled down DS laser. Here each of the 70+ ISD's have a DS laser (though it takes a second to make its way to the core of the planet since its not as strong) and one even uses it to blow up a planet. 

*A hidden planet full of Sith Cultists filled with weapons- In DE Palpatine fled to the planet Byss and hid there while he hid and built up his navy and weapons. He does the same thing with Exegol in this movie.

*   Hidden Fleet blitzing the galaxy and destroying the New Republic- This is much more of a TFA thing but it is still something from DE. Now in DE he didn't blow up Coruscant but the NR was forced to flee and become the Rebel Alliance again basically and fight the Empire for a few months before it fell. Much like in this saga.  This was also done in SWTOR with the eternal Fleet. 

*More minor things- Both Star Killer and Galaxy gun destroy important planets. Kor stand in for the Inquisitors. Both involve ragtag rebel fleets. Both have Luke facing down AT-AT's. and a few minor things I'm sure others have noticed that I failed to.

* The Prophecy of The Chosen One- On one hand we have DE which was written before the prophecy was even a thing. On the other hand we have Master and Apprentice recontextualizing the prophecy as well as Anakin's voice during the final fight. So this one is up to the people. I was never a fan of the prophecy since all it took to break the old version was a random person finding a tablet and calling themselves sith.  

Now we are going to talk about Legacy War. Now Legacy War may not be as familiar to people as DE. Basically all you need to know is that its in 147ABY and Cade Skywalker is a ex jedi turned bounty hunter who the Sith Emperor wants to capture to heal him. Legacy was forced to end about fifty issues quicker than expected so  Legacy War is them trying to tie up every possible thread. 

* Sith Troopers- The sith emperor that everyone thought was dead comes back with a hidden fleet of super powerful warships and troopers called sith troopers. These troopers are hyper loyal to him and have been trained in secret. Much like out new sith troopers

*We also have him being found in the UR (or core) on a hidden planet in a skeletal state by one of his disciples and he stays in this state until healed

* Sith Emperors obsession with Skywlaker- The sith emperor wants the Skywalker (or in this case the skywalker and his grand daughter) so that he can heal himself and live forever. This can also be said of DE. Seems to be a common theme. 

*Force Healing- In legacy its Cade Skywalker who can heal. He at first does it out of fear of loosing the ones he loves and uses the dark side to do it. But eventually learns how to do it out of love and the lightside. We see both Rey and Kylo use force healing.

* The Sith Fleet destroying its self when the Emperor dies- The new Sith Fleet in Legacy was much more powerful than the NR and Fel Empire fleet and was about to win untill the emperor died. When the Emperor died all Sith vessels crashed into the nearest planet (in this case coruscant). At the end of TRoS we see all of the FO ships crashing and going down in flames ending their threat as quickly as they came. 

*A new republic remnant fleet fighting against a new imperial fleet- This is more Legacy than Dark Empire since in Legacy the whole NR government was destroyed and it was only a admiral who didn't give up the fight who was still continuing.  

* Skywalker who stuggles with a pull to both the light and dark- Cade turns to death sticks to keep Luke from visiting him and has to find peace and forgiveness after what happened to the temple and everything he did. However unlike Kylo Cade got a really cool visit from his grandfather who believes in the scared straight approach. 

And here are some little things that don't really match to DE or Legacy so much as other stories or just general tropes

*Sith Alchemy- I love Sith Alchemy and it gets used a lot in legends and in canon with the nightsisters and Palpatine himself. Here its used to bring him back and keep him alive

* Sith spirit possessing someone- In the Jedi Academy books the Sith spirit of Exar Kun talks Kyp Durron into turning to the darkside and doing some bad things. It ranges from just talking inside his head to pushing him to do things/controlling him. And as Palps said in the trailer he had been all the voices in Ben's head. So Ben had been in the same shape Kyp was in. 

*Force Teleportation- We first learned about this in the Thrawn Dulogy. Secret alien monks who could teleport things with the force. Luke eventually kinda learned this skill but never mastered it. And in the NEU we see Merrin and the Nightsisters teleporting things and people. Here we see Rey teleporting Anakin's saber from her hand to Kylo who is in another room.

* Force bonds- Bastila/Revan  Luke/Mara  Do I really need to explain this one?

*Jacen Solo- Same for this one. Not even worth mentioning. 

*  the loyalists in the movie are like the Sith Eternal cultists and Vitiate's second attempt at controlling the galaxy was the Eternal Empire much like Palps has the First Order and his second hidden fleet. He even changes its name to the Final Order . 

 Their are also some that say their are Kotor connections but I honestly don't see it. Rey isn't that much like Bastila except that she is a white brunette and as of the last min of the movie has a double bladed orange saber. So appearances and a force bond are all we really have with that. 

For Kylo its even less. Just basically a mask with a big reveal behind it. He wasn't leading a army against Mando's or Sith. He didn't turn his fellow students. He didn't have a apprentice turn on him. And he wasn't captured and brainwashed to be a jedi again. I'm sorry but I don't see this one. 

So is their anything from DE or Legacy War or any other EU story you think I'm missing when it comes to big story beats or force powers? I think I bacialy covered everything. Again its so weird how this came out to be so close to DE and and Legacy. And I think it will kind of take Dark Empires place in the New canon. I might post a bigger version of this later on when the movie has been out longer but for now this is all I could think of.",1599,8404,Movies,0.78,14,1,126223,46529,2019-12-19 02:36:47

514,My first Star Wars without my dad...,"Hey all

Getting quite hyped for ROS now. And then it dawned on me  this will be the first Star Wars I see without my dad. He passed away March of this year. 

Now he had a massive influence on my liking of the saga. He did name me after Luke after all (he tried to have my sister called Leia. But my mum was having none of it!) I even got married on May 4th. 

Just going to be a little weird without him by my side in the cinema for the last film in the saga. 

I'm just glad he introduced me to such a saga all those years ago  when I was a youngling. I would often spend time looking at the Ralph McQuarrie concept art from a new hope admiring the art.

 I can remember going to see the re-release of the original trilogy before the release of EP.1 and then seeing the midnight release of Phantom Menace with him.  

I got a lot of the original figures off him  which I will hand down to my children. I will carry on the legacy by getting my children involved in the series (my daughter is already besotted with Baby Yoda after watching one episode of The Mandalorian). 

Just thought I'd share this. And to anyone else seeing this movie in the saga for the first time with out their loved one  May The Force Be With You.",243,1225,,0.89,138,21,2927,10918,2019-12-18 14:26:27

527,Reflection on the 3 trilogies. (No spoilers),"At the time of writing this post I have not seen the Rise of Skywalker  but have just completed my yearly rewatch of all the movies. 

Just recently watching the movies I started to think about the ‚Äúwars‚Äù part of Star Wars  and how each deals with the ideas of war within the context of its era. 

Prequel Trilogy: Coming out during the Wars in the Middle East the prequels focuses on war as a political tool. The clone wars were an almost unnecessary conflict used merely brought upon by a lust for power from both the trade federation and palpy. Clones and droids are disposable entities used as pawns in a sadistic game of chess. Even the supposed good guys are fighting a pointless war  more or less in the name of religion. It is a time of moral grey areas  and it contrasts heavily from the original trilogy.

Original Trilogy: Coming out during the late years of the Cold War  the original trilogy is at its core a fight between good and evil. There are no shades of grey because the argument of the original trilogy is that morality should be as subjective as we often see it as  what is important is doing the right thing. The original trilogy explores the necessity of war and rebellion  when the powers that be are not righteous. Politically it argues for the little guy and the power of the proletariat. 

Sequel Trilogy: Coming out at a time of relative peace  with none of the world superpowers in any significant war or conflict  these movies are a tales of anti-war. The costs of war are very apparent. Good people die  important people die because in the end they weren‚Äôt all that important. The war takes the lives of both of the factions without judgment. The only one who really benefits from war is the weapon sellers  and even their casino gets destroyed. The trilogy  or rather the first 2 movies argues that war isn‚Äôt worth it  because the positive benefits from war can be obtained without it. The sequels seem to be war movies that argue against wars. While the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù are a bit more righteous once again  their fight for freedom is not without its victims. 

I know it‚Äôs a bit random  and the sequel trilogy isn‚Äôt even over yet  but I just thought it was interesting to look at how each trilogy deals with one of the titles words. What do you guys think?",417,2286,Movies,0.79,8,7,6073,10255,2019-12-19 06:05:22

Even then the projectile or laser or whatever moves in reality and has a maximum velocity of c. They would have to calculate the orbit of the planets around that star and the spin of that star system and then it would have to calculate how to get past every system in between wherever starkiller base was and the Hosnian system or whatever.,111,565,General Discussion,0.75,17,19,231,21,2019-12-19 00:04:51

But Sifo Dias was all ""they dont know it jet  but war will come.. i build an army anyway"" .. so he went to kamino and ordered one of with his personal savings...

Palpatine realised this and went to install brain manipulating chips in every soldier like ""yeah they will be my personal army"" ..

Years later Obi Wan found the army and told the jedi council and they were like ""oooooh daaaamn the boy really build an army""..

Just in this time the CIS was like ""fuck the republic  we manage better alone  lets just kill 'em all""..

So the Jedi realized that this army made by their bro Sifo Dias would come in really handy and so they used it..",160,836,Other,0.76,6,8,35,202,2019-12-19 05:38:23

555,On the aging of Yoda's species,"I haven't seen Rise of Skywalker yet  so if there's any additional information given there  I don't have it.

We know 3 things about Yoda's species aging.
1) Yoda says he's 900 years old in ROTJ.  I think we can safely assume this is a generalization (he's not exactly 900  as opposed to 901 or 899).
2) Yoda says that he's trained Jedi for 800 years in ESB.  I think we can again assume this is a rounded number.
3) The Child is 50 according to Episode 1 of The Mandalorian.  This is more likely to be an exact age  given it's given as part of the target data for a bounty.  He appears to be roughly equivalent to a 2-3 year old in terms of human development.

Given 1 & 2  we can assume that Yoda began training Jedi somewhere between 100 & 200 years of age.  That makes him at youngest  twice the age of the child  at oldest 4 times.  If the development phase is relatively linear  this would be the equivalent of a 4-12 year old human.  This option seems unlikely.  The youngest example we have of a Jedi beginning to train another would be Ahsoka being assigned as Anakin's Padawan when he was 19 or 20 (Obi-Wan was 25 when he began training Anakin).  By my rough estimate above  a 20 year old human would be roughly equivalent to a 300-400 year old Yoda.  

Given this  the most likely option is that Yoda's species has an extremely slow development phase leading to a roughly ""normal"" final phase  albeit a long lived one.  Something roughly equivalent to a ""tadpole"" phase that lasts between 45-50 years.  At this point they mature into the regular Yoda-like form.  They then develop at roughly human speed  and live approximately another 800-900 years in this form.",312,1674,Mix of Series,0.67,4,2,59442,13095,2019-12-19 09:19:02

562,"Plausible theory about reys backstory ,haven't seen the new movie yet :)","So lately guys I have been pondering about the true identity of rey and her true purpose in the skywalker saga. I propose a very plausible theory about her back story. She is actually anakins mother. At first this theory may seem silly  but once one indulges themselves into the extreme lore that is on the website rule 34 it is clear that this is in fact true. Firstly they are both white. Secondly they both like to indulge in people that are on the dark side of the force. For example emperor palpatine created anakin and rey likes kylo. This all but conforms this theory and i can't wait for this to be explored during the course of the film as this can make for some good banta. For example when kylo wants to fornecate with rey she can be like lmao im your great grandmother anyway who cares lets hit it you know I love them swollen dark side nips.

570,lightsabers and ambient effects,"Having seen lightsabers on-screen a number of times I was wondering if anyone was wondering whether the ambient effects of the sabers are done correctly in the later movies?

My vote is that it should be. I was worried that this last movie wasn't up to the task of tying together the new trilogy and also the original 6 films. But it actually did  quite well I would say.
That sentence which was something like ""There are things more important than blood"" is the be all end all of the entire Saga. It condenses the meaning of 1-3 and 4-6  that your destiny is not tied to where you came from genetically  but the choices you make.

Anyway  I'll be glad to hear your thoughts on the film  and your vote on the canonization of 7-9 as the new (and final) trilogy for the Saga.

591,I have a few questions and theories about the new film about a few things meaning definite spoilers for those who haven't seen it. So please don't read this thread,"honestly I really enjoyed the movie  like I really enjoyed it  cause it properly subverted my expectations  rian! There were a few knit picks and things that made me question a few things but it did solve plot holes from the previous film. 
I somehow forgot a few of the occurring events even though I saw it 12 hours ago but oh well. Here are the questions and theories and statements that I have  warning this does contain spoilers so you are warned 

(I know I'm very early cause I'll forget to post this later)

LAST WARNING DONT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET  SO IF I SPOIL IT FOR YOU DON'T GET MAD CAUSE I WARNED YOU IN ALL CAPS 


Last chance to not be spoiled 


One thing I'm speculating is that the sith fleet is all cloned from a single ship and crew  cause the imperial fleet was made up of 25 thousand ships  and it was said that palpatines fleet was the biggest by far  to get the reseorces for that would be impossible  cause they struggled enough to get stuff for da death star  plus why supports my speculations is that palpatine is a  fucking powerful bastard and he can clone shit. Like he said in this film and revenge of the sith is ""the dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"". Also how could the resistance take out over 25 thousand ships  if this truly were the largest fleet the galaxy ever saw than it would have to be bigger than the yuuzhan vong (yes it's legends but I'm using it as a point like cause it was a massive fleet the entire galaxy struggled to fight it)  which was a massive fleet  and for decades the galaxy struggled to fight them  I know they got thousands of ships from all the other people but all the destroyers would have much more tie fighters  it just doesn't make sense. Also like why didn't they have towers on all the ships  I mean like they could've made a lot of arrays  (you can't tell me they couldnt've cause like they had the resources to make something way larger than the death star)

Also wasnt the entire second death star obliterated in explosion meaning how could there  be anymore fragments that large  it doesn't make much sense

Also how did palpatine survive his fall with his body in a bit tact  I reckon he used one of his clones and passed his soul into it  he probably could do it cause according to him all the sith are within him and if Rey kills him it will all be in her  much like all the Jedi being in Rey  

Another thing is that isn't a theory is just that is kinda kylos cousin.... Or something like that  (it's a weird family tree)  making reylo incest. The reason why I say this is the fact of Rey being a palpatine  and palpatine created anakin (mentioned the Vader comics and original script for rots). This means that kylo is technically biologically related to Rey.... Reylo = incest... (I know they did kiss but they don't know it)

I know it's early to post this but I will probably forget about this stuff. And I'm pretty impatient",555,2961,Spoilers,0.56,1,6,3515,4514,2019-12-19 13:31:42

610,My thoughts on ROTJ,"It was triumphant and action-packed but slightly disappointing after ESB. In fact  I think it's the most disappointing of the OT  but still fun and charming. It may not be on part with ESB  but it still has some of the most memorable and joyful moments of the saga. I felt like it was a satisfying conclusion to a great franchise. Despite it being the weakest of the OT imo  it was a solid film and a good ending to the trilogy.

611,Miniatures in Prequel Trilogy,I recently heard the exterior of Dexter‚Äôs diner in Attack of the Clones was a hand-wired miniature.

But the part where they get really annoying is when they hate a part of the movie so much that they ruin it for others. 

The ‚Äòjourney‚Äô (which is the closest word I can think of without spoiling what I‚Äôm trying to say) of one character has been pretty much confirmed to me about 5 times now. Literally. I now know one of the last conversations certain characters have and why they have those conversations. 

It really pisses me off that people are inconsiderate. That when you block these people  they have to post dialogue in their Twitter Bios or post the last shot of the movie on their background.

All Anakin had to do all along was to just die in order to fulfill the Chosen One prophecy. What are your thoughts? Hahaha

658,"Would you be OK with a digital ""remake"" of some of the Star Wars films or the entire franchise?","Star Wars is one of those franchises you should *never* remake. 

Because that's the thing with movies  once they're published  there's no going back to fix errors or plot holes. Unless you remake the movie entirely. However  seeing as how Disney has run the Star Wars gist into the drain  it makes me wonder: 

ü§î ""Would I be ok with it if they digitally remade the Star Wars franchise  but altered some scenes and bits that were deemed shitty by the general public  or extend or shorten some scenes?""

With Digital Remake  i mean use CGI so **good** you can't see the difference between the real deal and CGI. We might be getting good CGI these days  but we can still see the difference on human beings or other living things in movies.

So say we'd ever get to that level  as a big Star Wars fan  would i be ok with that?

Thinking of the advantages  I imagine making the Millenium Falcon out-maneaouvering the Star Destroyers scene in Ep V  better by having Leia actually steer the Falcon more intensely while Han and Chewwy were off trying to fix the Hyperdrive. 
Because it looks like the Auto-pilot was doing it all  evading those TIE fighters. 

Or ship walkways in the older movies move as modern as in the newer films. 
Or make some scenes that would seem corny  be redone. I'm sure you can think of a few.

Would I be ok with that about *any* movie?!
On the plus side  it would be that you keep and respect the original actors but you just change the plotline or action bits a bit and republish it as a Digital Remake instead of an actual Remake with entirely different cast and plotline.

On the negative side  it would make the original movie be forgotten and we don't like it when people mess with the olden goldies. Nostalgia and all that.

But I guess we would always have the original exist at least. A remake  without different cast and crew  - let's officially call it a Digital Remake - would be titled as such. And thus would just be an updrade/update of the original content. 

What do you think?
Got any scenes you wouldn't mind seeing altered?

661,What jumped out on your rewatch?,"Like so many of you  I've been rewatching the movies  and I've been pleasantly surprised by new details I keep noticing. Revenge of the Sith was the first I watched in 4k on D+  and I was surprised to see added scenes - not a bunch  and I didn't write them all down  but I remember feeling like they were all positive.

In the OT  two things stuck out to me in Return of the Jedi. (I hardly think I'm the first to catch these  but it was the first time I was struck for either). One was a parallel between Luke and Anakin  when he leaves to go save Han & Leia (Chewie didn't need saving  change my mind). The way he was rushing into danger to save someone  not entirely knowing what to expect but going against what he's supposed to do  really reminded me of Anakin leaving Naboo for Tatooine  albeit less whiny.

The other detail I really liked was the way Vader tells Piett  ""Asteroids don't concern me  Admiral."" That felt like the kind of thing Anakin would have said in Clone Wars. How many scenes are there in Clone Wars where Anakin charges headstrong after his target? But where in Clone Wars he has Obi-Wan and the other Jedi (and Ahsoka) to keep him in check  here he has Palpatine surrounding him with anguish and anger and stoking his passion & telling him he only needs strength & power. Asteroids don't concern him  only the mission. Only victory.",254,1361,Movies,0.84,4,2,106092,8170,2019-12-19 02:47:09

702,"I don't have many friends into Star Wars that I can talk to, so I need to get this off my chest about The Mandalorian","In my opinion  The Mandalorian is the best thing to happen to SW since Disney took over. To me  it just *feels* so Star Wars.  Jon Favreau said in a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKxBPBmNOd8): 

>""I grew up with Star Wars  so you wanna make sure you're servicing it in a way that's respectful to what came before  and in a way that hopefully delights the audience and the fans""

He then goes on to say: 

>""There's something about falling in love with something at a certain age and just like taste in music or taste in food  or your favourite pizza place  it has to do with what you first experienced when you were growing up  and Star Wars is that thing for me""

As someone who grew up with the OT  Star Wars has always been 'that thing' for me too. Whilst I've enjoyed what was made after ROTJ  nothing else has ever felt like the Star Wars that I loved as a kid (except Rogue One).

Based on the quotes above from Favreau  you can really tell that he wanted to make something that felt like the OT. He's achieved that: 

* The show has humour (but not in a distractingly childish way) 
* It feels gritty and realistic (the way its shot; from the camera angles to the transitions and that classic 'used Universe' feel that was important to Lucas)
* CGI is used sparingly and where only necessary (far too often CGI is used just because it can be  and not when it should)
* The 'fan service' just works. Old vehicles  troopers  aliens  but it all just feels right and unforced. Not at any point does it feel like things have been added unnecessarily. 
* Even the new designs (ships  aliens etc.) don't feel OTT or out there  everything feels like it should be in this galaxy
* The writing: I've just watched Chapter 7 and you can see that there was a clear plan as to what they wanted to achieve. Each episode has been enjoyable and  a lot of time  exciting. 

I could go on but I'll stop boring anyone who reads this...

I like the ST  but I don't love it. Same for Solo and the PT. I don't hate on anything Star Wars and I know that they need to make things to cater for new audiences but I feel as though this show  it ticks all the boxes for old and new fans alike. It doesn't alienate any fans  and it welcomes new ones. 

I can't wait to see the final Chapter (and TROS tonight!).

2. Why does Kylo Ren seek to commune with Darth Vader  who somewhat turned to the light at the end of episode 6? Could this be why he's conflicted between the light & dark?
3. Why are there too many happenstances in episode 7? Millenium Falcon happens to be right there  not on the planet there but RIGHT there. They travel to a random planet to get help to the rebellion base  & Anakin's lifesaver is there. Rey gets captured and contained exactly where Han & friends happen to pop up on the new death star. At least Luke & Han in episode 4 searched the station's database lmao.
4. Why does everyone hate the prequels? I understand that the acting was a bit cheezy  but the story & political background were pretty lit.
5. Do you think the Hux dude could have a Sith role  but be hiding it? He's freaking badass IMO.
6. Shouldn't Leia have been the one to train Rey in the ways of the Force? I feel that's a good plot blown away. I guess Rey just learns of the Force and decides to use it right off the bat. Leia goes back to being some rebel leader like she's always been  even after learning she's literally Luke Skywalker's sibling rofl.
7. Luke did pretty much the same thing as Anakin  ignored the Jedi's council and stuff. What makes Luke's story different? He was supposed to continue his training  but he was able to suppress the dark side I guess? I mean  why wasn't Anakin able to? Cause he knocked up a hot babe?
8. Edit: Going from episode 6 to 7 was really hard. I could tell that the new movies have fallen prey to modern movie making. Scenes are cut off and unexplained  camera angles constantly changing  etc. The originals have longer scenes & cuts that aren't necessarily forcing your attention.

724,This will probably be the last time John Williams will compose music for Star Wars and I hope everyone appreciates it.,"Star Wars is amazing  there's so much about it that makes it amazing  but I have no doubt in my mind that it would not have grown to be so popular had it not been for the amazing original score by John Williams. What he brought to the series was an achievement in itself  you can watch the film start to finish without dialogue  letting the music carry the story  and it would do such a great job of it. It changed film scores forever. Then Empire came along and with it the Imperial March and well  I can go on and on about the music in the films but I don't need to because you know it all very well. 

Star Wars musical score is probably the most recognizable music from films globally and it's something that is a rarity these days  for the most part new film scores are not as melodic  original  nor as incredible as what John Williams brought us over the years. The music from Star Wars is something that I think we can all celebrate. Regardless of how you feel about the direction of the series  you can't deny that the music that John Williams has written for each trilogy has always been incredible. While we might be divided on the films themselves  I think we could all come together and appreciate what he has given us over so many years. 

This man is 87 years old  and still writes music for us. How amazing is that? So when you go into the theatre this weekend or over the holiday season  remember to soak in the incredibles soundtrack  because I promise you it will carry the film regardless of how great the film itself is  because his music always does  from Superman  to Indiana Jones  to Home Alone and Harry Potter and so much more  John Williams has always made films better even when they were already amazing to begin with  and it may be the last time you'll get to experience something so incredible.",341,1825,"Audio, Music",0.98,3074,164,36443,39602,2019-12-17 12:07:07

The one thing that bugged me was that the films lacked a certain vision  TLJ completely disregards what was set up in TFA and the new one disregards what TLJ revealed (Rey's parentage) because they were originally being helmed by different directors but JJ was still brought back. Even the writers of each films are different. There's no consistency at all.

Now say what you would about the prequels and even the orig trig (Lucas did not direct them all but he was THE GUY who's vision they were following) They were telling one single story. 

The MCU has Kevin Feige. One of the reasons it was so successful was because even though there were different people telling different stories they all tied together because he was in control.

774,The chosen one prophesy,"There have been discussions on here about Anakin being the chosen one (which he is)  but what is the actual prophecy? Wookiepedia states that the prophesy is that ""A Chosen One shall come  born of no father  and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored."" The quote has no reference and I cannot find its source. In Episode I  it is stated by Windu about the prophecy that ""You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force."" 
Now neither of the quotes mentions the downfall of the sith. The jedis interpret it as the elimination of the sith. Also  it does not discuss on what ""balance"" is. From the jedis' point of view  they again perceive it as the elimination of the sith/dark side users. 

From my point of view  i believe that the jedi became full of hubris in the time of peace  thinking that they would sense any plans the sith would put into place. Hince why they did not consider Palpatine to be Darth Sidious until it was too late. They also strayed from the true path if the jedi since they were no longer peace keepers but now generals in a war machine. 

Another extreme POV of mind is that the Jedi were wrong on not teaching the dark side and always stating that that it was dangerous. The force is not inherently good or evil but on how it is used. 

Another theory of mine is that the balance of the force was achieved through the destruction of both the sith and jedi.

777,In preparation for TROS I took some time to reflect on the sequels and Disney‚Äôs takeover as a whole; I welcome you all to do the same.,"Maybe Dave Filoni  Gareth Edwards  or Ron Howard should be given a shot at a stand-alone trilogy  they seem to be the ones that have gotten a lot of it right in the end and really captured the feeling of Star Wars since Disney took over *in my opinion*.


Honestly anything would be better than the science experiment that they ran on us with the Sequels. I‚Äôm not an avid hater of them  but the fact that they played Director-Hot Potato with the last 3 parts of the Skywalker saga doesn‚Äôt really sit well with me. Almost every last bit of content since Disney took over besides the sequels has been planned out/improved adequately and received its fair share of praise  but the sequels almost feel like they weren‚Äôt a priority in the long run regardless of how important they *should* have been.

 It may just be me though  but I‚Äôm happy this week marks the end of speculation and worry for fans. Even if the movie bombs  it‚Äôll be the end of an era and the beginning of (finally) something new. Should it be bad  i take it that you guys will most definitely make sure they learn from their mistakes. Star Wars as a whole is something that generations have grown up with  and shouldn‚Äôt be prioritized as a business decision first with the actual love and care second. It isn‚Äôt about being ambitious or finding high shock value  or the hundreds of other tropes  it‚Äôs about telling a story. Let‚Äôs all hope this story wraps up nicely at least.",264,1439,General Discussion,0.69,6,6,2069,4683,2019-12-18 18:13:38

In a galaxy I used to know

That movie used to make me smile

And I knew that if I had my chance 

That I wanted one more circumstance 

A new trilogy would make me happy for a while

‚Ä¶ But The Last Jedi made me shiver

With every mom joke that was delivered

Bad news on the doorstep

I couldn't take one more step

‚Ä¶ I can't remember if I cried

When I saw Princess Leia fly

Something touched me deep inside

The day that Star Wars died

So

‚Ä¶ Bye  bye my Star Wars bye  bye

Drove my speeder to the feeder but the feeder was dry

787,Why is Phantom Menace considered so bad?,"I never understood why  but at the same time I'm not that deep in Star Wars. I just saw the movies and thought they were cool  and played some star wars games at the time.

When I first saw the prequels I was still young  but I rewatched them a few times since then  and I didn't find anything that I thought was terrible  or something outlandish that just took me out of the immersion.

Why is the Phantom Menace considered to be soo bad? Is it something to do with the story  or is it something to do with cinematography and acting? Is it something about a plothole  or is it more about bad script writing or pointless scenes?

I'm looking for things that are non-subjective for the most part. Something that is such a glaring thing that it can not be argued for. Something that  regardless of my preferences  could make me see why Phantom Menace was bad(if that is really the case).",166,885,Movies,0.78,10,43,22696,6016,2019-12-18 15:15:36

790,I cant wait for the Skywalker Saga to be over.,"When the Force Awakens came out  I enjoyed it a good deal. And I loved The Last Jedi (although I acknowledge and agree with alot of its flaws  namely the entire Admiral Holdo storyline  but I loved everything with Luke  Kylo  and Rey.) And while I'm looking forward to The Rise of Skywalker  I'm mostly looking forward to the numbered saga films being over.
These films carry with them such high expectations that can never be met. There was 32 years between episodes 6 and 7  and every kid on the planet imagined what an episode 7 of star wars would be like. And no matter what Disney did  nothing would have made everyone happy. I understand if you dont like the sequels trilogy  I understand and respect that  but the amount of almost unnatural hate and arguing these movies incite in the fandom is exhausting  and quite frankly  embarrassing. I want the Skywalker Saga to be over so people can shut up about it. And I'm sad that I feel that way. Rouge One and Solo dont carry nearly as much hate behind them even from the people who make it seem that Disney is Satan incarnate and Rian Johnson violated your childhood and shot your dog. And I think that is because they are dont carry the same expectations as a numbered saga film. I personally am looking forward to the future of the franchise  where the films wont be as weighed down as much by the franchise's own legacy. And we can just judge the movies as movies  and hopefully simply critique and enjoy (or respectfully dislike) the new entries in a series we all love.

793,Why weren‚Äôt the Jedi more concerned about the massive clone army they didn‚Äôt order?,"So I posted this on r/NoStupidQuestions and somebody suggested I post here. I‚Äôm hoping I can get a more detailed answer! Also I‚Äôve only watched the Star Wars movies  not anything in the extended universe  so I apologize in advance if the answer is obvious.

Watching Episode 2 and 3 raised some serious questions. Obi Wan discovers an army of one million clones supposedly ordered by a Jedi who died something like ten years prior to Obi Wan‚Äôs discovery. The Jedi Council had no idea he‚Äôd ordered an army  which seems like a pretty big deal because they call themselves peacekeepers  not soldiers/warriors so ordering an army of one million clones would be a huge deal. Obi Wan responsibly reports the army to the Jedi Council  because that‚Äôs pretty shady  and the Council says they will investigate.

Episode 3 comes and the Jedi are surrounded by the same clone army they didn‚Äôt order.

With the looming Separatist war  I understand the convenience of the clone army suddenly appearing. But with the looming war and the fractured senate  the Jedi should have already been wary. They already didn‚Äôt trust Palpatine. If that‚Äôs not enough reason to at least be a little more cautious  they know there‚Äôs some super powerful Sith Lord hiding in the shadows and waiting to take them down. With the Jedi who supposedly ordered the army dead  they can‚Äôt ask him why he ordered it. Also  the bounty hunter who was going after Padme was living where the clone army was being assembled! He even tried to kill Obi Wan!

The whole thing seems like a pretty huge strategic blunder. The Sith basically Trojan Horsed the Jedi  and they didn‚Äôt even do it that well. There were so many red flags surrounding the whole situation that I‚Äôm more surprised the Sith didn‚Äôt wipe the Jedi out sooner....

I‚Äôd love to know your guys‚Äô thoughts because I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs an answer and if anybody knows it they‚Äôre going to be here! Thank you!",335,1921,,1.0,10,13,734,591,2019-12-18 15:22:18
794,The Rise of Skywalker is amazing (no spoilers),"Just came out of the midnight launch here in Australia. My expectations going into this film were extremely low - I absolutely hated The Last Jedi with a passion and was unsure how JJ could rectify RJs shit show.

What I can say is that JJ did an incredible job of ending this saga  I have no idea why the critics have rated it so badly I‚Äôm a bit baffled to be honest. I wanted to make this post to say please give it a shot. 

Is it a perfect film? No  and I‚Äôm not saying that and obviously this is just my opinion. If you hated TLJ this film is completely different  it feels different and it looks different  and I‚Äôm impressed by how they were able to end the saga - I strangely feel at peace (probably because I  like many others  hated some of the decisions made leading up to this film)

But yeah  please give it a shot and I hope you all enjoy it. I‚Äôm looking forward to being able to speak about spoilers in the coming days and weeks with you all",186,954,,0.5,1,32,54,217,2019-12-18 19:07:53
